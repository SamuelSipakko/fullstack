## Running locally

Frontends can be run locally with `npm start` and backends with either `node indes.js` or `npm run watch` depending on the scripts in package.json file. Remember to install node modules with `npm install`.

Note that some of backend applications may need **.env** files. Required variables that should be included in those files can be seen from config source (code) files.
